The SM83 processor uses a typical layout from the 70-80's: the "brain" is on top and the registers and ALUs are on the bottom.

The upper part outputs to the lower part a large number of control signals for connecting registers to buses, ALU operations, etc.

For the SM83 the layout is slightly different: the ALU is on the top-left and at the bottom purely registers and auxiliary logic for switching buses.
